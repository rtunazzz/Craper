# Craper
> A collection of product scrapers for various websites.

## What does this do?
This script can scrape product images from various websites (listed below) by their product IDs. Those product IDs then can be used to get early links/ early PIDs for each website.

When the command is ran, it looks for new products, saves any new ones into a database and sends you a Discord webhook for each new product found.

## Setup
> Python 3.9+ is required!

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rtunazzz/Craper
```
2. Create required files
```bash
./bin/config.sh
```
3. Add your webhooks, footer & color preferences into the `craper/config/config.json` file.
4. (*Optional*) Add proxies to the `craper/config/proxies.txt` file
> If you're struggling with setting up these configuration files, I recommend checking out [these](./craper/config/examples.md) examples!

### Note
Proxy usage is not required but recommended for websites that ban often, such as Solebox, Snipes or Onygo.

## Installation
There is two ways you can install this. Either as a global command, which will be always available from your terminal or just as a Python script.
> Make sure to have everything [set up](###Setup) properly before installing.

#### As a command
```bash
python3 setup.py install
```

Then you can go ahead and start using the command:
```bash
# Show the usage info
craper -h

# Start a Footpatrol scraper
craper footpatrol

# Start 10 Footpatrol scrapers, each scraping 100 product IDs
craper footpatrol -t10 -n100

# Start one scraper with proxies, starting from pid 01925412
craper solebox -pt 1 -s 01925412
```

#### Python script
You may also run the scraper as a Python script. If you would rather not install the package, you can just clone this repo and use `python3 __main__.py` instead.
```bash
# Show the usage info
python3 __main__.py -h

# Start a Footpatrol scraper
python3 __main__.py footpatrol

# Start 10 Footpatrol scrapers, each scraping 100 product IDs
python3 __main__.py footpatrol -t10 -n100

# Start one scraper with proxies, starting from pid 01925412
python3 __main__.py solebox -pt 1 -s 01925412
```

<br></br>

## Example
```bash
craper size -t10 -n5 -s 10
```

## FAQ
#### I am getting an error saying something like `file not found`/ `file doesn't exist`
You likely either didn't clone this repository or didn't change the active directory of your terminal to this repo. Check out [this](https://projectdestroyer.com/2018/01/run-scripts-github/) article from Project Destroyer and follow the steps mentioned.
